web.php is an extremely lightweight PHP MVC framework originally
inspired by _why's MVC Microframework "Camping". It soon ended up
looking like `web.py`, so it was renamed and recoded.

Example
-------

    <?php
    require 'web.php';
    
    $urls = array(
        '/(.*)' => 'Hello'
    );
    
    class Hello {
        function get($page) {
            if (empty($page)) $page = "world";
            echo "Hello $page!";
        }
    }
    
    run($urls);
    
    ?>
